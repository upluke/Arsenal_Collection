    <h1>Timers Exercise</h1>
    <h3>countdown</h3>
    <p>Write a function called countdown that accepts a number as a parameter and every 1000 milliseconds decrements the value and console.logs it. Once the value is 0 it should log “DONE!” and stop.</p>
    <h3>randomGame</h3>
    <p>Write a function called randomGame that selects a random number between 0 and 1 every 1000 milliseconds and each time that a random number is picked, add 1 to a counter. If the number is greater than .75, stop the timer and console.log the number of tries it took before we found a number greater than .75.
